# AI-OCHSMS
This repository contains the design and mockup files for the AI-OCHSMS assignment.

## Project Overview
AI-OCHSMS is a proposed AI-based system for scheduling and predictions in healthcare management. The system is designed to:
- Manage patient data
- Predict patient schedules using AI
- Provide a user-friendly interface for staff

## Folder Structure
- `MockCode` : Contains pseudocode showing how the AI module and system workflow would function

## How the System Works 
1. Patient data is added to the system.
2. AI module analyzes data and predicts optimal schedules.
3. Output is displayed to staff for scheduling decisions.
